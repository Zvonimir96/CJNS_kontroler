# About
The idea of the project is to create an electronic version of the game LUDO to promote the STEM field. Game idea was first implemented in Python to test the basic design and control logic. Created game can be downloaded from the [Git repository](https://github.com/Zvonimir96/LUDO-Python). Once the software solution was created, development of the hardware design began. Developmnet of hardware design is available on the [Git repository](https://github.com/jkordek1/Man-Don-t-Get-Angry-Board-game). This project includes developing a software solution for the created hardware.
